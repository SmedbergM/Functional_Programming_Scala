### `flatMap`
(`def flatMap[B](f: A => IterableOnce[B]): Iterable[B]`)

You can think of `flatMap` as a generalized version of the `map` method. The function `f` used by `flatMap` takes every element of the original collection, but instead of returning just one new element of a different (or the same) type, it produces a whole new collection of new elements. Those collections are then "flattened" by the `flatMap` method, which results in just one big collection being returned.

The same, basically, can be achieved with `map` followed by `flatten`. `flatten` is another method from the Scala collections. If the original collection is a collection of collections - that is, if every element of it is a collection itself - the `flatten` method will combine them into one new collection.

But the applications of `flatMap` extend far beyond this simple use case. It's probably the most crucial method in functional programming in Scala. We will talk more about it in the later chapters about monads and chains of execution. But for now, let's focus on a simple example that will show how exactly `flatMap` works.

Just as in the `map` example, we will use a list of four cats. But this time, for every cat, we will create a list of cars of different brands but the same color as the cat. Finally, we will use `flatMap to combine all four lists of cars of different brands and colors into one list.

```scala
// We define the Color enum
enum Color:
 case Black, White, Ginger

// We define the CarBrand enum
enum CarBrand:
 case Volkswagen, Mercedes, Toyota

// Letâ€™s import the Color and CarBrand enum values for better readability
import Color._
import CarBrand._

// We define the Cat case class with two fields: name and color
case class Cat(name: String, color: Color)

// We define the Car case class with two fields: brand and color
case class Car(brand: CarBrand, color: Color)

// We create four cats, two black, one white, and one ginger
val felix    = Cat("Felix", Black)
val snowball = Cat("Snowball", White)
val garfield = Cat("Garfield", Ginger)
val shadow   = Cat("Shadow", Black)

// We put them all in a list
val cats = List(felix, snowball, garfield, shadow)

// We define a function which takes a cat and produces a list of cars
def catToCars(cat: Cat): List[Car] =
 List(
   Car(Volkswagen, cat.color),
   Car(Mercedes, cat.color),
   Car(Toyota, cat.color)
)

// And we use the flatMap method and the catToCars function to create a new list of all cars of all colors
val cars: List[Car] = cats.flatMap(catToCars)
```
