# Pattern Matching

Pattern matching is one of the most important features in Scala. 
It’s so important that we may risk saying that it’s not *a* feature of Scala,  but *the* feature. 
It affects every other part of the programming language to the point where it’s difficult to talk about anything in Scala 
without pattern matching being mentioned or used in a code example. 
You have already seen it — the match/case statements, the partial functions, and the destructuring of instances of case 
classes.

In this lesson we will touch upon case classes and objects, ways to construct and deconstruct them, enums, and a neat 
programming trick called the `newtype` pattern.
